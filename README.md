Idea For Assignment 1
My idea for my Assignment 1 was to redesign the current Singapore Popeyes Wesbsite and make it more modern. I also made a new cart shopping system for the user to conveniently shop for Popeyes fast food.

External User’s Goal:
Target audience for this assignment are teenagers, young adults, families, regular Popeyes customers who wish to make Popeyes orders online.

Site Owner’s goal:
Creating a responsive website that allows users to order from and view Popeyes news is the idea behind my assignment.

Design Process:
I kept to Popeyes signature Orange and White color scheme but removed the red to give the website a more modern and sleak look. Its very minimalistic as I want the website to be easy on the eye's of the user.
I also incoperated Popeyes's new logo of the little orange chicken which i noticed the Singapore Wesbite is missing.
